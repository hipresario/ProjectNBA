NBA Champion is always the target for most of NBS team owner. 
1)	Salary vs Salary Cap
NBA has the team salary cap which  is a limit on the amount teams can spend on player contracts, which helps to maintain competitive balance in the league. Without a salary cap, teams with deeper pockets could simply outspend the remaining teams for the better free agents. A luxury tax payment is required of teams whose payroll exceeds a certain "tax level", determined by a complicated formula, and teams exceeding it are punished by being forced to pay bracket-based amounts for each dollar by which their payroll exceeds the tax level.
We can extract the total salary of every year’s champion team (or top 8 teams from East conference and top 8 teams from West conference), and compare with that year’s salary cap amount (and compute the average team salary for the top 8 teams). 
We can have the how much money spent to win one game. By comparing with the Salary cap, team owner can understand how much he/she needs to invest.
